## ✅ Step-by-Step Simple Breakdown
🔹Step 1: Load the Data
🔹Step 2: Clean the Data
      🧠 This means: Some values in "TotalCharges" were not numbers (like empty strings). So we told Python:
      👉 “Convert everything to numbers. If it fails, mark it as missing (NaN).”
   Then we told it:
      👉 “Fill those missing values using the middle value (median) of the column.”
🔹 Step 3: Convert Text to Numbers.
🔹 Step 4: Convert Categorical Columns
            ➡ Text values like “Payment Method = Credit Card” are turned into 1s and 0s. 
                  This is needed because machine learning works with numbers, not text.

🔹 Step 5: Split into Training & Testing
            X = Features like tenure, charges, contract, etc.
            y = What we want to predict: whether they stayed, churned, or joined
            We split data: 80% for training, 20% for testing
🔹 Step 6: Train the Model
            🧠 This builds the model. It learns patterns from the training data.

🔹 Step 7: Check How Well Model Works

✅ It predicted “Stayed” correctly 939 times!
✅ But sometimes made mistakes predicting "Joined" as "Churned", etc.

Overall: Accuracy is 97% — that’s awesome!
Precision and F1-score also look high. This means it’s doing a great job.
🔹 Step 8: Predict New Customers

🧠 Meaning:
1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 5th customers will Stay (0)
4th customer is predicted to be Joined (2)

🔹 Step 9: Feature Importance
🧠 This tells you: “These features matter the most when the model decides whether someone churns or not.”

For example:

1. If customer left because of a competitor, the model gives that high weight
2. Longer tenure usually means they will stay
3. Total revenue/charges help indicate their value and history
