## Telecom Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction AI (ML)
This project uses a real-world telecom dataset to build a machine learning model that **predicts customer churn** and **reveals the top reasons behind it**. Businesses can use this model to **retain valuable customers** and **reduce revenue loss** 💰

## 🎯 Business Problem
Telecom companies lose millions due to customer churn. By predicting **who is likely to leave** and understanding **why**, we can take proactive actions to:
- 🛑 Prevent churn  
- 🤝 Improve customer satisfaction  
- 📈 Maximize long-term revenue

## 🧠 3️⃣ Tools & Skills Used
✅ SQL (Exploratory Data Analysis, Business Insights)  
✅ Python (Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
✅ AI/ML (Random Forest Classifier for churn prediction)  
✅ Data Visualization & Feature Importance  
✅ Google Colab for implementation

## 💡 4️⃣ What I Did 
📌 Used SQL to explore customer churn patterns:
    • Identified churn trends based on contract type, tenure, and payment method
    • Grouped customers as new, mid, or long-term based on their tenure
    • Found top regions with high churn using aggregate queries
📌 Loaded CSV dataset into Google Colab and cleaned it using pandas
📌 Built an ML Model using Random Forest Classifier to predict if a customer will churn
📌 Analyzed the most important features affecting churn using feature importance charts
📌 Achieved high model performance and created business-ready insights

## 💥 5️⃣ Outcome
✅ Built an AI-powered churn predictor with ~80%+ accuracy  
✅ Delivered data-driven recommendations to reduce customer loss  
✅ Demonstrated end-to-end workflow: SQL → Python → ML → Insights
